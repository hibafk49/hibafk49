⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer virus was created in 1983 by a programmer named Fred Cohen?
     He developed the virus as a way to demonstrate the potential vulnerabilities of computer systems.
     Little did he know, his experiment would pave the way for the modern cybersecurity industry,
     inspiring countless innovations in digital protection and defense against malicious software.
